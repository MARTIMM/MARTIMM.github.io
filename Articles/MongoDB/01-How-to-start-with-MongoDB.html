<article class="post"><header><h2>MongoDB and BSON Howto</h2></header><aside><p>The Perl 6 modules MongoDB and BSON are maintained by me and can be found <a href="https://github.com/MARTIMM/mongo-perl6-driver" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/MARTIMM/BSON" target="_blank">here</a>.
      However, the modules are also registered in the Perl 6 module library so
      when panda is installed you can also install them using panda;<pre>
&gt; panda install MongoDB
&gt; panda install BSON</pre>The last command is not really necessary because the MongoDB is dependent
      on it and panda will install it automatically.</p></aside><p>The minimal use of the MongoDB driver is loading the driver, make contact
    with the server, then do your thing and close it down. In this example a
    connection with the localhost is made on port 65000.<PLACEHOLDER-ELEMENT/><pre>
use v6;
use MongoDB::Connection;

my MongoDB::Connection $connection .= new(:port(65000));
my MongoDB::Database $database = $connection.database( 'test');
my MongoDB::Collection $collection = $database.collection( 'perl_users');

my Hash $document1 = {
  'name'      => 'PaweÅ‚ Pabian',
  'nick'      => 'bbkr',
  'versions'  => [ 1, 2 ],
  'author'    => {
      'BSON'          => 'https://github.com/bbkr/BSON',
      'Integer::Tiny' => 'http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Integer%3A%3ATiny',
  },
  'IRC' => True,
};

$collection.insert($document1);
</pre>What is also noticeable is that only MongoDB::Connection is loaded. This is
    because that module needs MongoDB::Database and that one in turn needs 
    MongoDB::Collection. So these modules you will also get by initializing a
    database and a collection.</p><footer><hr/><p>Marcel Timmerman 2015-08-21</p></footer></article>
