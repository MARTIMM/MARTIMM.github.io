# Here at MARTIMM's

MARTIMM is my account name on github and used on other sites as well such as cpan and pause.

This is a site setup as a main entry point to the documentation of all my projects. Most of the projects are libraries or programs written in the **Raku** language, formerly known as **Perl 6**. There are also a number of projects to create a mobile app for **Android** tablets and phones.

Some of them are small and there would not much to tell about. Others are somewhat bigger that there is some documentation for it. Most of the time I keep some reference for the publicly available subs and methods for libraries or options and argument usage for programs.

There are also large projects. These projects not only have references but also have tutorials and examples, well, at least planned to have them ðŸ˜ƒ.

This site will mainly show links to other projects documentation. Maybe I might blog even....


Anyways, have fun!
