        about every possible section of the language ranging from classes and
        objects, containers etc to grammars and regular expressions. There is
        also good information about the many types used in perl 6 and builtin
        routines under which there are operators (Almost everything in perl
        are objects and operators are functions or methods).</p></li><li><p><PLACEHOLDER-ELEMENT/><strong><a href="http://smoke.perl6.org/report" target="_blank">perl6 smoke tests</a><br/></strong>A list of test results is shown where rakudo is changed to a new
        version. I am not doing well at the moment :-/. See <a href="http://smoke.perl6.org/report/MARTIMM">MARTIMM</a>.</p></li></ul><footer><hr/><p>Marcel Timmerman 2015-06-13</p></footer></article>
