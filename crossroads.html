about every possible section of the language ranging from classes and
objects, containers etc to grammars and regular expressions. There is
also good information about the many types used in Perl 6 and built-in

are objects and operators are functions or methods).</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="http://pl6anet.org/" target="_blank">perl 6 planet</a><br/></strong>Latest news(weekly).about changes and bug fixes in and around perl 6.

version. I am not doing well at the moment :-/. See <a href="http://smoke.perl6.org/report/MARTIMM">MARTIMM</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="http://testers.perl6.org/" target="_blank">perl6 module test reports</a><br/></strong>A list of test results of Perl6 modules based on reports send by panda
when the environment variable PANDA_SUBMIT_TESTREPORTS is set to 1.

version its backend is used and which module version of the module is
tested.</p></li></ul><footer><hr/><p>Marcel Timmerman 2016-03-14</p></footer></article>
