You can find information about every possible section of the language ranging from classes and objects, containers etc to grammars and regular expressions. There is also good information about the many types used in perl 6 and builtin routines under which there are operators (Almost everything in perl are objects and operators are functions or methods).</p></li><li><p></p></li></ul><footer><hr/><p>Marcel Timmerman 2015-03-20</p></footer></article>
